<ul>
      
<li class="green">Alternative Titles: Ragnar Lodbrog, Ragnar Lodbrok, Ragnarr Loðbrók, Regnar Lodbrog, Regnar Lodbrok, Regnar Lothbrok, Regner Lodbrog, Regner Lodbrok, Regner Lothbrok
Ragnar Lothbrok, Ragnar also spelled Regner or Regnar, Lothbrok also spelled Lodbrog or Lodbrok, Old Norse Ragnarr Loðbrók, (flourished 9th century), Viking whose life passed into legend in medieval European literature.</li>
 <br>     
<li class="green">Ragnar is said to have been the father of three sons—Halfdan, Inwaer (Ivar the Boneless), and Hubba (Ubbe)—who, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and other medieval sources, led a Viking invasion of East Anglia in 865. They may have sought to avenge Ragnar’s death, which may or may not have been murder, or they may have been claiming land to which they believed they had a right as a result of a previous invasion by Ragnar that may or may not have actually happened. This sort of ambiguity pervades much that is thought to be known about Ragnar, and it has its roots in the European literature created after his death.
<br>
In the Gesta Danorum (c. 1185) of the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus, for example, Ragnar was a 9th-century Danish king whose campaigns included a battle with the Holy Roman emperor Charlemagne. According to Saxo’s legendary history, Ragnar was eventually captured by the Anglo-Saxon king Aella of Northumbria and thrown into a snake pit to die. This story is also recounted in the later Icelandic works Ragnars saga loðbrókar and Þáttr af Ragnarssonum.</li>
 <br>     
<li class="green">The 12th-century Icelandic poem Krákumál provides a romanticized description of Ragnar’s death and links him in marriage with a daughter of Sigurd (Siegfried) and Brynhild (Brunhild), figures from the heroic literature of the ancient Teutons. The actions of Ragnar and his sons are also recounted in the Orkney Islands poem Háttalykill.</li>

<li class="green">
Viking, also called Norseman or Northman, member of the Scandinavian seafaring warriors who raided and colonized wide areas of Europe from the 9th to the 11th century and whose disruptive influence profoundly affected European history. These pagan Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish warriors were probably prompted to undertake their raids by a combination of factors ranging from overpopulation at home to the relative helplessness of victims abroad.</li>
 <br>     
<li class="green">Halfdan, (flourished 9th century), founder of the Danish kingdom of York (875/876), supposedly the son of Ragnar Lothbrok, the most famous Viking of the 9th century.
<br>
After participating in raids on Anglo-Saxon lands to the south, Halfdan and his followers invaded the mouth of the River Tyne (874) and engaged in warfare with both Picts and the Britons of Strathclyde. In 876 he distributed the large region of York among his men and may then have left to join Viking campaigns in northern Ireland; he may be the Danish king “Albann” who was slain near Strangford Lough in 877. By another account he remained in York until 883.

<li class="green">chronological account of events in Anglo-Saxon and Norman England, a compilation of seven surviving interrelated manuscript records that is the primary source for the early history of England. The narrative was first assembled in the reign of King Alfred (871–899) from materials that included some epitome of universal history: the Venerable Bede’s Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, genealogies, regnal and episcopal lists, a few northern annals, and probably some sets of earlier West Saxon annals. The compiler also had access to a set of Frankish annals for the late 9th century. Soon after the year 890 several manuscripts were being circulated; one was available to Asser in 893, another, which appears to have gone no further than that year, to the late 10th-century chronicler Aethelweard, while one version, which eventually reached the north and which is best represented by the surviving E version, stopped in 892. Some of the manuscripts circulated at this time were continued in various religious houses, sometimes with annals that occur in more than one manuscript, sometimes with local material, confined to one version. The fullness and quality of the entries vary at different periods; the Chronicle is a rather barren document for the mid-10th century and for the reign of Canute, for example, but it is an excellent authority for the reign of Aethelred the Unready and from the reign of Edward the Confessor until the version that was kept up longest ends with annal 1154.

The Chronicle survived to the modern period in seven manuscripts (one of these being destroyed in the 18th century) and a fragment, which are generally known by letters of the alphabet. The oldest, the A version, formally known as C.C.C. Cant. 173 from the fact that it is at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, is written in one hand up to 891 and then continued in various hands, approximately contemporary with the entries. It was at Winchester in the mid-10th century and may have been written there. It is the only source for the account of the later campaigns of King Edward the Elder. Little was added to this manuscript after 975, and in the 11th century it was removed to Christ Church, Canterbury, where various interpolations and alterations were made, some by the scribe of the F version. The manuscript G, formally known as Cotton Otho B xi (from the fact that it forms part of the Cotton collection of manuscripts at the British Museum), which was almost completely destroyed by fire in 1731, contained an 11th-century copy of A, before this was tampered with at Canterbury. Its text is known from a 16th-century transcript by L. Nowell and from Abraham Wheloc’s edition (1644).

The B version (Cott. Tib. A vi) and the C version (Cott. Tib. B i) are copies made at Abingdon from a lost archetype. B ends at 977, whereas C, which is an 11th-century copy, ends, mutilated, in 1066. Their lost original incorporated into the text in a block after annal 915 a set of annals (902–924) known as the Mercian Register.

The D version (Cott. Tib. B iv) and the E version (kept at the Bodleian Library, Oxford, Laud Misc. 636) share many features, including the interpolation of much material of northern interest taken from Bede and from annals also used by Simeon of Durham; hence they are known as the “northern recension.” D has also dovetailed into its text the Mercian Register and contains a fair amount of northern material found in no other version. It is quite detailed in the English descent of Queen Margaret of Scotland. D, which is kept up until 1079, probably remained in the north, whereas the archetype of E was taken south and continued at St. Augustine’s, Canterbury, and was used by the scribe of manuscript F.

The extant manuscript E is a copy made at Peterborough, written in one stretch until 1121, and kept up there until the early part of 1155. It has several Peterborough interpolations in the earlier sections. It is the version that was continued longest, and it includes a famous account of the anarchy of Stephen’s reign.

The F version (Cott. Domit. A viii) is an abridgment, in both Old English and Latin, made in the late 11th or early 12th century, based on the archetype of E, but with some entries from A. It extends to 1058. Finally, the fragment H (Cott. Domit. A ix) deals with 1113–14 and is independent of E, the only other version to continue so late.</li>
